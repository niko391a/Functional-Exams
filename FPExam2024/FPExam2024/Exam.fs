module Exam2024

(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find when switching back to project mode.

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

    Q: What do the function foo, bar, and baz do.
       Focus on what they do rather than how they do it.

    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo, bar, and baz?

    Q: The function foo only behaves reasonably if certain 
       constraint(s) are met on its argument.

    (*

    Q: The function `bar` from Question 2.1 is not tail recursive. Demonstrate why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation. 
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function 
       is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must 
       evaluate to the same value ( (5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27 , for instance).
       
       You do not have to step through the foo-function. You are allowed to evaluate 
       that function immediately.
