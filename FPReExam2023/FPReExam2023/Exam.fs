module ReExam2023

(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

    * A: `baz xs`
    * B: `bar x`
    * C: `(ys, x::zs)`

    Q: In the context of the baz function, i.e. assuming that `x`, `xs`, `ys`, and `zs` all have the correct types,
       what are the types of snippets A, B, and C, expressed using the F# syntax for types, and what are they --

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    
    Q: * Explain the use of the `and`-operator that connect the `foo` and the `bar` functions.
       * Argue if the program would work if you replaced `and` with `let rec`.

(* Question 2.4: Tail Recursion *)

    (*

    Q: The function `baz` is not tail recursive. Demonstrate why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation. 
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function 
       is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must 
       evaluate to the same value ( (5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27 , for instance).
       
       You do not have to step through the foo- or the bar-functions. You are allowed to evaluate 
       those function immediately.
