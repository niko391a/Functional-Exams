(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

(* Question 2.1 *)

    (* 
    
    Q: What are the types of functions foo and bar?

    A: 
    foo has type int -> string
    bar has type int list -> string list


    Q: What does the function bar do.
       Focus on what it does rather than how it does it.

    A: 
    foo converts an int to binary 
    bar converts a list of integers to their binary counterparts
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo and bar?

    A: 
    foo would be toBinary()
    bar would be listToBinary()
        
    Q: The function foo does not return reasonable results for all possible inputs.
       What requirements must we have on the input to foo in order to get reasonable results?
    
    A:
    the input must be a non negative number and larger than 0

(* Question 2.2 *)

 
    (* 
    The function foo compiles with a warning. 

    
    Q: What warning and why?

    A: 
    the warning is:
    stdin(4,9): warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. 
    For example, the value '1' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s). 
    However, a pattern rule with a 'when' clause might successfully match this value.
    
    This is due to the function not having an explicit pattern for negative integers

(* Question 2.3 *) 
    let bar2 (lst : int list) : string list = lst |> List.map foo

(* Question 2.4 *)

    (*

    Q: Neither foo nor bar is tail recursive. Pick one (not both) of them and explain why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation.
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function is not tail recursive.
       Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must evaluate to the same value
       ((5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27, for instance).

    A: 
       foo 5
       foo (5 / 2) + "1"
       foo (foo (2 / 2) + "0") + "1"
       foo (foo (foo (1 / 2) + "1") + "0") + "1"
       foo (foo ("" + "1") + "0") + "1"
       foo ("1" + "0") + "1"
       "10" + "1"
       "101"
    
    The reason that foo is not tail recursive is because the recursive call to foo is not the last operation performed.
    After each recursive call returns, the function still needs to append either "0" or "1" to the result.
    This means that the function must save each call frame on the stack to finish the string concatenation after returning from the recursive call.
    In a tail-recursive function, there would be no additional work to do after the recursive call.
        
    Q: Even though neither `foo` nor `bar` is tail recursive only one of them runs the risk of overflowing the stack.
       Which one and why does  the other one not risk overflowing the stack?

    A:
    foo does not run the risk due to the limitation of what is allowed in a 32bit signed integer
