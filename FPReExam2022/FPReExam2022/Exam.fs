module Exam2022_2
(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

    Q: What are the types of functions foo and bar?

    A: <Your answer goes here>


    Q: What do the functions foo and  bar do. 
       Focus on what it does rather than how it does it.

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo and bar?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
        
    Q: The function foo uses an underscore `_` in its third case. 
       Is this good coding practice, if so why, and if not why not?

(* Question 2.4 *)

    (*

    Q: Only one of the functions `foo` and `bar` is tail recursive. Which one? 
       Demonstrate why the other one is not tail recursive.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation.
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function is not tail recursive.
       Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must evaluate to the same value
       ((5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27, for instance).
