(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile again.

   You will also need to load JParsec.fs. Do this by typing
   #load "JParsec.fs" 
   in the interactive environment. You may need the entire path.

   Do not remove the module declaration (even though that does work) because you may inadvertently
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the module declaration as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment

(* Question 2.1: Types, names and behaviour *)

    (* 
    
    Q: What are the types of functions foo, bar, and baz?

    A: 
    foo has type 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list option
    bar has type 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
    baz has type string -> string -> string


    Q: What do the function foo, bar, and baz do.
       Focus on what they do rather than how they do it.

    A: 
    foo: removes repeated occurrences in a list when comparing two identical lists where the first list is longer than the 2nd
        if the 2nd list is longer than the 1st then None is returned
    bar: also removes repeated occurrences in a list when comparing two identical lists where the first list is longer than the 2nd
        but if the end list is inconsistent instead of returning None it will return the whole 1st list
    baz: Removes identical parts of the first string when comparing it to the 2nd string if the 2nd string
        is longer than the 1st then the 1st string is simply returned
    
    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions 
       foo, bar, and baz?

    A: <Your answer goes here>
    foo would be called: SubtractOrDiscard
    bar would be called: SubtractOrReturn
    baz would be called: SubtractStringOrReturn
    
    *)
        

(* Question 2.2: Code snippets *)

 
    (* 
    The function baz contains the following three code snippets. 

    * A: `[for c in a -> c]`
    * B: `[for c in b -> c]`
    * C: `List.fold (fun acc c -> acc + string c) ""`

    Q: In the context of the baz function, i.e. assuming that `a` and `b` are strings, 
       what are the types of snippets A, B, and C and what are they -- 
       focus on what they do rather than how they do it.
    
    A: 
    snippet A: Type string -> char list, it converts the string a, into a list of chars
    snippet B: Type string -> char list, it converts the string c, into a list of chars
    snippet C: Type char list -> string -> string, it takes the list of chars and slowly accumulates a string by appending the chars to acc
    
    Q: Explain the use of the `|>`-operator in the baz function.

    A: The piping operator is used to insert the result of bar into the List.fold higher order function.
        It is syntactic sugar as Jesper would call it, as it helps us make the code look cleaner.

    //               | x :: xs' -> x :: (bar xs' ys) 
    (*

    Q: The function `bar` is not tail recursive. Demonstrate why.
       To make a compelling argument you should evaluate a function call of the function,
       similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and reason about that evaluation. 
       You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the function 
       is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must 
       evaluate to the same value ( (5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27 , for instance).
       
       You do not have to step through the foo-function. You are allowed to evaluate 
       that function immediately.
